abstract = {We construct a network of 1.6 million nodes from banking transactions of users of Rabobank. We assign two weights on each edge, which are the aggregate transferred amount and the total number of transactions between the users from the year 2010 to 2020. We present a detailed analysis of the unweighted and both weighted networks by examining their degree, strength, and weight distributions, as well as the topological assortativity and weighted assortativity, clustering, and weighted clustering, together with correlations between these quantities. We further study the meso-scale properties of the networks and compare them to a randomized reference system. This will be the first publicly shared dataset of intra-bank transactions, and this work highlights the unique characteristics of banking transaction networks with other scale-free networks.},
